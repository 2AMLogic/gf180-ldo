# Work Plan

<!-- guide:plan-body:start -->
## Operator Attention: Merge-Risk-Hold Pileup

Judge-approved PRs stuck under a `loom:operator` merge-risk hold — implementation work is done, only a human merge decision is missing.

_None._

## Operator Priority

Issues the operator starred (`loom:operator-priority`); land these first.

_None._

## Ready

Human-approved issues ready for implementation (`loom:issue`).

- **#302**: soft-start: make the FB-injection element's settled residual supply-independent, so the ratified 50 dB PSRR row closes (DR-0031 / T8)
- **#312**: error_amp mixes ppolyf_u_1k and ppolyf_u_3k, which gf180mcu cannot build on one die — DR-0033 needs amending (blocks #284)
- **#352**: Investigate the gmin-stepping 'nonconvergence' diagnostic on the DR-0037 self-biased servo (possible zero-current operating point)

## In Progress

Issues currently being built (`loom:building`).

_None._

## PRs Awaiting Review

PRs waiting on Judge (`loom:review-requested`).

_None._

## Approved (Awaiting Merge)

PRs that passed review and are queued for Champion auto-merge (`loom:pr`).

_None._

## Proposed

Issues carrying `loom:curated`.

- **#16**: Post-layout extracted re-run of the full verification suite *(curated)*
- **#43**: Soft-start: two per-startup transients (loop acquisition and hand-over) still break the inrush and overshoot clauses *(curated)*
- **#79**: Track the gap to T1 sim-validated / bronze (klayout-tools design-evidence tiers) *(curated)*
- **#173**: [Epic #542 follow-on] Layout the gf180-ldo LDO block (DRC/LVS-clean GDS) + post-layout PVT re-verification *(curated)*
- **#212**: Startup is 60× slower than TLV7xx because of the ramp bound, not the process — restate the Startup row as a startup-current budget at 1 µF and re-centre the soft-start ~5× faster *(curated)*
- **#259**: soft-start: recover the ~7.18 uA the FB-injection transconductor's degeneration branches burn after hand-over (Iq row binds at 1.29 uA, not 1.96 uA) *(curated)*
- **#284**: [Parent #173] Lay out the error amplifier as a DRC/LVS-clean cell registered in drclvs.py's CELLS *(curated)*
- **#302**: soft-start: make the FB-injection element's settled residual supply-independent, so the ratified 50 dB PSRR row closes (DR-0031 / T8) *(curated)*
- **#312**: error_amp mixes ppolyf_u_1k and ppolyf_u_3k, which gf180mcu cannot build on one die — DR-0033 needs amending (blocks #284) *(curated)*
- **#320**: ldo_ilimit's Fbias / ldo_softstart's Fss_ramp: replace the idealized VREF-derived bias-current mirror with a real device (blocks #290, #291) *(curated)*
- **#351**: Explain the 2x lower peak Icap / dV/dt at soft-start with the DR-0037 bias servo (142 vs 282 mA at tt/27C) *(curated)*
- **#352**: Investigate the gmin-stepping 'nonconvergence' diagnostic on the DR-0037 self-biased servo (possible zero-current operating point) *(curated)*

## Proposed (Architect / Hermit)

- **#170**: [Epic #542] 3A — gf180-ldo maturation + Challenge #5 brief *(architect)*
